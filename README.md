# placeholder-to-value
Use the placeholder text as a value on readonly input fields

Usage Notes:
* There are no settings - once activated the plugin will just work as needed.
* The plugin only works on the WooCommerce checkout page. No other inputs on other pages will be impacted by this plugin.
* The plugin looks for any fields that are readonly. It then takes the placeholder text and uses that for the field's value. It then removes the field's placeholder text.
